# Chrobelias - Chrobak exponential linear integer arithmetic solver

__Chrobelias__ is a theorem prover (SMT-solver) for deciding existential exponential linear integer arithmetic based on the finite-automata approach for deciding (i.e. [existential Semёnov arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14593), existential theory of `<N, 2**x, +, =>`).

## Dependencies
To build the project you'll need these dependencies to be installed:
- OPam - OCaml package manager.
- OCaml >5.0.

You may install the dependencies using the following bash commands:
```bash
# This would install OCaml package manager and the OCaml 5.2 itself.
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
opam switch create 5.2.0+flambda --packages=ocaml-variants.5.2.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda --yes
```

## Building

The Chrobelias prover can be built like this:

```bash
# Installing project dependencies.
opam install . --deps-only --with-test

# Building the project and its tests.
opam exec -- dune build @check @all
```

The executable binary is available in the `_build` dir.

## Usage

You might execute `.smt2` files in `LIA` or custom exponent arithmetic with Chrobelias that's defined with `ALL` in .smt2. Later allows you to use custom `exp` functional symbol.

```bash
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe <path-to-smt2-file>
```

There are a few `.smt2` examples available within the `examples` dir.

```bash
# Frobenius coin problem for 7 11 13
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe ./examples/fcp_7_11_13.smt2

# Proof ExEy y >= 0 & x = 2**y & x > 4.
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe ./examples/basic-exp-sat.smt2
```
