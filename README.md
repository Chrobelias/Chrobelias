# Chrobelias - Chrobak exponential linear integer arithmetic solver

__Chrobelias__ is a theorem prover (SMT-solver) for deciding existential exponential linear integer arithmetic based on the finite-automata approach for deciding (i.e. [existential Semёnov arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14593), existential theory of `<N, 2**x, +, =>`).

## Dependencies
To build the project you'll need these dependencies to be installed:
- OPam - OCaml package manager.
- OCaml >5.0.

You may install the dependencies using the following bash commands:
```bash
# This would install OCaml package manager and the OCaml 5.2 itself.
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
opam switch create 5.2.0+flambda --packages=ocaml-variants.5.2.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda --yes
```

## Building

The Chrobelias prover can be built like this:

```bash
# Installing project dependencies.
opam install . --deps-only --with-test

# Building the project and its tests.
opam exec -- dune build @check @all
```

The executable binary is available in the `_build` dir.

## Usage

You might execute `.smt2` files in `LIA` or custom exponent arithmetic with Chrobelias that's defined with `ALL` in .smt2. Later allows you to use custom `exp` functional symbol.

```bash
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe <path-to-smt2-file>
```

There are a few `.smt2` examples available within the `examples` dir.

```bash
# Frobenius coin problem for 7 11 13
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe ./examples/fcp_7_11_13.smt2

# Proof ExEy y >= 0 & x = 2**y & x > 4.
./_build/default/bin/chro.exe ./examples/basic-exp-sat.smt2
```

## Chrobelias REPL

Chrobelias offers CLI REPL for experimenting. It allows defining predicates, proving theorems, and visualizing the automaton the solver builds. By default opam builds an executable in `./_build/default/bin/chro.exe`. Starting it up brings you to REPL for evaluating theorem proving. We strongly encourage you to run it the following way.

```bash
ledit ./_build/default/bin/chro_repl.exe
```

Using common unix `ledit` allows navigating through the input and switching the history of executed commands.

You might list the examples and information on how to use the REPL using the `help` commands.

Chrobelias uses the syntax defined by the following grammar rules for expression first-order logic statements:

```
formula := (formula)
         | ~formula                    (* not *)
         | formula & formula           (* and *)
         | formula '|' formula         (* or *)
         | formula -> formula          (* imply *)
         | formula <-> formula         (* iff *)
         | E var formula               (* exists *)
         | A var formula               (* forall *)
         | atomic_formula

atomic_formula := term = term          (* equals *)
                | term != term         (* not equals *)
                | term < term          (* less than *)
                | term > term          (* greater than *)
                | term <= term         (* less or equal *)
                | term >= term         (* greater or equal *)
                | pred term+           (* custom predicate *)

pred := [a-z_][a-z_0-9]*

term := (term)
      | const * term | term * const    (* multiply by const *)
      | term + term                    (* sum *)
      | 2**term                        (* 2 to the power of... *)
      | var
      | const
var := [a-z_][a-z_0-9]*
const := [0-9]+
```

Example usages:
```
> eval Ax Ey x = y + 1
  sat

> let even x = Ey x = 2*y
> eval AxAyAz x + y = z & even(x) & even(y) -> even(z + 1)
  unsat

> eval AxAyAz x + y = z & even(x) & even(y) -> even(z)
  sat

> eval ExEyEz 2**x = 2**y + 2**z + 7
  sat
```
